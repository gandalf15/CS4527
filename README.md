This dissertation reports the development, testing and evaluation of Interplanetary Smart City
(IPSC), a fully decentralised peer-to-peer system designed to allow secure data exchange. This
system can be deployed in a variety of scenarios, from smart homes to interplanetary smart cities.
I proposed, developed and evaluated a new data exchange mechanism. It is built with the use of
Hyperledger Fabric v 1.0 blockchain technology. IPSC enables secure, robust, reliable, scalable
and space aware communication without a central point of failure. The evaluation shows that
the system is able to provide all the mentioned advantages without the need for the traditional
trusted third party. However, it also shows that blockchain mechanism and consensus protocol
introduces additional overhead. Therefore, such a system is not suitable for time-critical or realtime applications.
